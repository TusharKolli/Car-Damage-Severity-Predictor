Car Damage Severity Assessment Using Deep Learning
Overview
This project aims to leverage Deep Learning techniques to assess the severity of car damage from images. The goal is to create an automated system that can quickly and accurately evaluate the extent of damage to a vehicle, assisting insurance companies, repair shops, and car owners in making informed decisions.

Objectives
Automated Detection: Identify and classify car damage from images.
Severity Assessment: Categorize damage into levels (minor, moderate, severe).
Efficiency: Ensure high accuracy and fast processing.
Methodology
Data Collection: Images labeled with damage type and severity.
Preprocessing: Resize, normalize, and augment images.
Model Development: Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Training & Validation: Train model on split dataset and evaluate performance.
Evaluation: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Technologies Used
Framework: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
Language: Python
Data Processing: OpenCV, PIL
Evaluation: Scikit-learn
Future Work
Expand Dataset: Include more diverse images.
Real-world Application: Integrate with industry applications.
Enhance Model: Use advanced techniques for better performance.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning to automate and improve car damage assessments, saving time and resources while ensuring reliable results.
