Overview :
  This project aims to leverage Deep Learning techniques to assess the severity of car damage from images. The goal is to create an automated system that can quickly and accurately evaluate the extent of damage to a vehicle, assisting insurance companies, repair shops, and car owners in making informed decisions.
Objectives :
  Automated Detection: Identify and classify car damage from images.
  Severity Assessment: Categorize damage into levels (minor, moderate, severe).
  Efficiency: Ensure high accuracy and fast processing.

Technologies Used :
  Framework: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
  Language: Python
  Data Processing: OpenCV, PIL
  Evaluation: Scikit-learn

Future Work :
  Expand Dataset: Include more diverse images.
  Real-world Application: Integrate with industry applications.
  Enhance Model: Use advanced techniques for better performance.
